# more_python_stuff
By Harry F. Martin III
---

---
Main reason to have this script (for me) is to have examples of different things I can use, because it's easier than searching through docs
The objective of this script is to use it as a location to learn
---

I will probably just stick each thing I learn into a separate file and just include it into here
- 100% what I did

~~Tomorrow I will work on updating this to work with anything I add to it~~ 
- [x] Done

~~The ideal layout, would grab everything in this folder, list it all, allowing the user (myself) to choose one and run it~~ 
- [x] Done

---
Everything Will actually be in this same dir because other wise it gets touchy
Should be easy enough, and well with-in my abilities.

After I finish that, I would like to add the ability to save input data, whatever we do to it, and output data with an easy comparison.

# Outline

---

1) First it loads into the main screen
    - Right now this loads into a GUI, will be getting rid of that.
    - Will be updated to load in browser for better display and output of different things
2) After it loads up it displays a list of current functions and asks the user which function they would like to run

3) In the future, it will add the functionality to save the output data
    - Be it a picture or a graph or just some simple data
