#   The object of this script is to use it as a location to learn
#   I will probably just stick each thing I learn into a separate file and just include it into here
#   Tomorrow I will work on updating this to work with anything I add to it
#   The ideal layout, would grab everything in this folder, list it all, allowing the user (myself) to choose one and run it
#   Should be easy enough, and well with-in my abilities.
#   After I finish that, I would like to add the ability to save input data, whatever we do to it, and output data with an easy comparison.
